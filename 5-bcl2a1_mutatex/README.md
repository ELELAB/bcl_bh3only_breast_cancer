# In silico mutagenesis

Using the in-house Python-based software, MutateX, developed for high-throughput mutagenesis in silico, we evaluated the effects of substituting wild-type residues at the BH3 binding interface of the modelled complexes with the mutant variants found in the cancer patients.

## To reproduce this analysis

### Prerequisites

MutateX and the associated scripts are written in Python, and requires having a working Python 2.7 installation. Alternatively with a Python 2.x (x >= 7) installation, the bash run sricpts must be corrected, i.e., [run_mutatex_OK.sh](complexes/computational/hrk_2/run_mutatex_OK.sh). A number of Python packages needs also to be available. More in details, mutateX requires:

```
BioPython
numpy
matplotlib
```

In addition MutateX works by running the FoldX software. The FoldX binary and the associated rotabase.txt file should be available. FoldX4 is available free of charge to academic affiliates; you will, however, need to register and login to download. See [FOLDX ACADEMIC LICENSE](http://foldxsuite.crg.eu/academic-license-info). The FoldX binary file should be readable and executable by the user who intends to run MutateX, and its location as well as that of the rotabase.txt file should be specied as system variables in profile or .bashrc.

### Installation

Get the MutateX package from the associated github repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ELELAB/mutatex.git 
```

Please refer to the [MutateX manual](https://github.com/ELELAB/mutatex/blob/master/doc/manual.lyx) for installation.

### Running the analysis

Before running this analysis we urge the user to read the parts of the manual clarifying how MutateX runs, the specified command line options and the outputs please see above mentioned manual. Specially the user should consider the number of cores they have available and possible change the number of cores in run_mutatex_OK.sh scripts.

If you have a multi-core machine (as you most probably have) you can greatly shorten the calculation times by allowing MutateX to run more than one instance of FoldX at the same time, using option â€“np, which specifies the number of cores to be used at the same time
