In the folder "7-allosigma", we included all the results collected to study the allosteric effects of the mutations of Y120 and all the files necessary to reproduce them.  
We performed the calculations using the AlloSigMa server http://allosigma.bii.a-star.edu.sg/home/ using the version available at September 2019.
We used two structure, located in the subfolder "structure": the X-ray structure of Bcl2a1 with PUMA BH3 (PDB entry 5UUL, in which we removed the side-chain conformational variations keeping the A states, named 5UUL-fix.pdb) and a conformation of Bcl2a1 with PUMA BH3 from the CABS-flex ensemble in which the sidechain of Y120 and the ones of its surrounding residues are reoriented, to take into account inherent flexibility in this region (named model3.pdb).
In the cancer mutation Y120C, a bulky large aromatic residue is substituted with a smaller one, so we expected that this mutation causes a loosening in the network of contacts. 
So we defined this mutation as a DOWN mutation, according to the AlloSigMA approach (see the AlloSigMa tutorial and the Materials and Methods of the manuscript for additional information), and performed the calculation.
All the output data are in the folder identified with the AlloSigMa JOB-ID (it can be used to retrieve the calculations) and the name of the structure: MNOWIXKS_model3 and T8YGDVQ8_5UUL for the model3.pdb and 5UUL-fix.pdb, respectively.          
Inside each folder there are: the structure used for the calculation as pdb file, a txt file with the per-residue values of Δ allosteric free energy in Kcal/mol caused by the Y120 DOWN mutation, a pdf file with a line plot of the data, a pdb file with the Δ allosteric free energy values inserted in the B-factor column, a folder WorkFiles with the outputs from AlloSigMA. 
To analyze the data, we compared the per-residue values of Δ allosteric free energy for 5UUL-fix.pdb and model3.pdb as line plot using the R script plot_all.R (see the Figure in the main text)
We also shown the per-residue values of Δ allosteric free energy for 5UUL-fix.pdb on its structure, by using a shade of color from yellow (negative values) to purple (positive values) (see the Figure in the main text).
