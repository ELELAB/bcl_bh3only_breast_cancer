Once the mutations have been retrieved following the instruction in the README1.md,
the analyses of occurrence of mutations of interest in TCGA samples can be reproduced
using the script tcga/breast.r

To retrieve the occurrence of the same mutations in ICGC, we used the ICGC Data Portal functionalities
 https://dcc.icgc.org/
